<ol>
  <li>Download <a href="https://cdn.cs50.net/2018/fall/lectures/0/src0/">one or more of them</a> or a ZIP of <a href="https://cdn.cs50.net/2018/fall/lectures/0/src0.zip">all of them</a>, which you should then unzip.</li>

<h3 id="step-1-of-2">Step 1 of 2</h3>

<p>Submit <a href="https://forms.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/0">this form</a>.</p>

<p>CS50 collects some start-of-semester data for planning purposes via Problem Set 0’s form, so expect the form to take 15 minutes or so. Subsequent problem sets’ forms will be much shorter!</p>

<h3 id="step-2-of-2">Step 2 of 2</h3>

<p>This step assumes that you’ve downloaded your <a href="scratch.md">Scratch</a> project as a file whose name ends in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.sb3</code>. And this step also assumes that you’ve <a href="https://github.com/join">signed up for a GitHub account</a>, per the above form.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Visit <a href="https://cs50.me/">cs50.me</a>, log in with your GitHub account, and click <strong>Authorize submit50</strong>.</li>
  <li>You should receive two emails from GitHub inviting you to join CS50’s “organizations” on GitHub. Click the button in those emails to accept both of the invitations.</li>
  <li>Go to <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://github.com/submit50/USERNAME</code>, replacing <code class="highlighter-rouge">USERNAME</code> in the URL with your own GitHub username.</li>
  <li>On the left side of the screen, click on <strong>Branch: master</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the field that says <strong>Find or create a branch…</strong>, copy and paste precisely this value, <code class="highlighter-rouge">cs50/2019/x/scratch</code>, then click <strong>Create branch</strong>. That value is just a unique identifier for this problem.</li>
  <li>Click the button that says <strong>Upload files</strong>.</li>
  <li>Drag your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.sb3</code> file into the box that says <strong>Drag files here</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click the green <strong>Commit changes</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it! If you visit <a href="https://cs50.me/">cs50.me</a> again, you should see your submission. If you click on the <strong>check50</strong> link next to the submission, you should see (after a minute or two) whether your project met all of the requirements. You are welcome to resubmit as many times as you’d like (before the deadline)!</p>

<p>If you don’t see any results on <a href="https://cs50.me/">cs50.me</a>, make sure that your branch is named <code class="highlighter-rouge">cs50/2019/x/scratch</code>. If you mistyped it the first time, you should create a new branch (repeating steps 5 and 6), making sure to name it <code class="highlighter-rouge">cs50/2019/x/scratch</code>!</p>
