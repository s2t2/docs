# Scratch

## Heads-Up

In lecture, David demonstrated Scratch 3, a new version of Scratch that MIT hasn't quite finished, otherwise known as a "beta." It lives at [beta.scratch.mit.edu](https://beta.scratch.mit.edu/). Even though it's not quite finished, it's better than Scratch 2, its predecessor, insofar as it's implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (languages that you'll soon know!) rather than Flash, an older technology that's disabled by default in most browsers these days.

Upon visiting [beta.scratch.mit.edu](https://beta.scratch.mit.edu/), be sure to click **Try It**. If you instead click **Not Now** or **View 2.0 Project**, you'll accidentally end up using Scratch 2!

The older version of Scratch, Scratch 2, lives at [scratch.mit.edu](javascript:return false;), but don't use that one! Odds are Google and other websites will link to that version, so take care not to end up there accidentally. With that said, even though Scratch 3's user interface looks a bit different from Scratch 2's user interface, they're functionally almost identical. So, if browsing tutorials for Scratch 2 online, odds are you'll still find them instructive.

Indeed, you might find these resources helpful in learning Scratch, even though they show Scratch 2's user interface:

1. [Scratch for Budding Computer Scientists](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/scratch/)
1. [Getting Started with Scratch](https://resources.scratch.mit.edu/www/guides/en/Getting-Started-Guide-Scratch2.pdf)
1. [Scratch Cards](https://scratch.mit.edu/info/cards/)

Most importantly, though, Scratch 3 does not let you save projects "in the cloud" (i.e., online) yet. So be sure to select **File > Download to your computer** every few minutes in order to save backups of your work! (That should download a file whose name ends in `.sb3`.) If you (accidentally) close your browser or shut down your computer, you can then resume you work by returning to [beta.scratch.mit.edu](https://beta.scratch.mit.edu/) and selecting **File > Upload from your computer**.

## Itching to Program

It's time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

* Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
* Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
* Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
* Your project must use at least one sound.
* Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than *Ivy's Hardest Game*. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

Here are your predecessors' [projects from last year](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/4248580/), though implemented in Scratch 2. But try to think of an idea on your own, and then set out to implement it. However, don't try to implement the entirety of your project all at once: pluck off one piece at a time. In other words, take baby steps: write a bit of code (i.e., drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test, write a bit more, test, and so forth. And select **File > Download to your computer** every few minutes so that you don't lose any work!

If, along the way, you find it too difficult to implement some feature, try not to fret; alter your design or work around the problem. If you set out to implement an idea that you find fun, odds are you won't find it too hard to satisfy the above requirements. 

Alright, off you go. Make us proud! 

Once finished with your project, select **File > Download to your computer** one last time, and keep that file so that you can submit it.
