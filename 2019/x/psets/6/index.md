# Problem Set 6

## What to Do

1. Submit, using CS50 IDE, [Hello](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/fall/psets/6/sentimental/hello/hello.html) in Python
2. Submit, using CS50 IDE, one of:
  - [this version of Mario](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/fall/psets/6/sentimental/mario/less/mario.html) in Python, if feeling less comfortable
  - [this version of Mario](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/fall/psets/6/sentimental/mario/more/mario.html) in Python, if feeling more comfortable
3. Submit, using CS50 IDE, one of:
  - [Cash](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/fall/psets/6/sentimental/cash/cash.html) in Python
  - [Credit](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/fall/psets/6/sentimental/credit/credit.html) in Python
4. Submit, using CS50 IDE, one of:
  - [Caesar](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/fall/psets/6/sentimental/caesar/caesar.html) in Python
  - [Crack](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/fall/psets/6/sentimental/crack/crack.html) in Python
  - [Vigenère](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/fall/psets/6/sentimental/vigenere/vigenere.html) in Python
5. Submit, using CS50 IDE, [Bleep](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/fall/psets/6/bleep/bleep.html) in Python

If you submit both versions of Mario; or both of Cash and Credit; or more than one of Caesar, Vigenere, and Crack we'll record the higher of your two scores.

## Advice

* Be sure you've watched Week 6's lecture.
  * You can run any of the programs from that lecture in Week 6's sandbox.
* Be sure to attend section or supersection!
* Consider this problem set an opportunity not only to port your own prior work from C to Python but to improve upon your earlier designs using lessons learned since! When porting code from C to Python in CS50 IDE, you might want to select **View > Layout > Horizontal Split** so that you can see both side by side.

## Academic Honesty

* For Hello, Mario, Cash, Credit, Caesar, Vigenère, and Crack, it is **reasonable** to look at your own implementations thereof in C and others' implementations thereof _in C_, including the staff's implementations thereof (and postmortems) in C.
* It is **not reasonable** to look at others' implementations of the same _in Python_.
* Insofar as a goal of these problems is to teach you how to teach yourself a new language, keep in mind that these acts are not only **reasonable**, per the syllabus, but encouraged toward that end:
  * Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines' origins.
  * Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set's problems or your own final project.
